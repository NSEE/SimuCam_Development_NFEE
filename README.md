# Repository Description - SimuCam/N-FEE
This repository manages the release of the the software packages related with the SimuCam project, focusing on its N-FEE version, whose directly user  is the [LESIA (Laboratoire d’études spatiales et d’instrumentation en astrophysique)](https://lesia.obspm.fr/). This projet is a part of PLATO mission, and it is being developed by the NSEE (Núcleo de Sistemas Eletrônicos Embarcados) team, a laboratory that is part of [IMT (Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia)](https://maua.br/) at São Caetano do Sul, São Paulo, Brazil, in a partnership with [USP-IAG (Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas)](https://www.iag.usp.br/) , funded by [FAPESP (Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo )](https://fapesp.br/).

# SimuCam
The SimuCam is an electronic system with 8 independent SpaceWires links, emulating the behavior of PLATO’s cameras (N-FEE and F-FEE), and controlled by Ethernet.
SimuCam will be used by ﬁve diﬀerent teams in the PLATO consortium, each one in a diﬀerent situation, ranging from software development to system integration. 
From the user point of view, SimuCam is able to emulate 6 normal cameras and 4 fast cameras and a spacewire data generator.

SimuCam has 3 different versions, depending on its final use:

# PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars)
PLATO (PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars) is the third medium-class mission in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme. Its objective is to find and study a large number of extrasolar planetary systems, with emphasis on the properties of terrestrial planets in the habitable zone around solar-like stars. PLATO has also been designed to investigate seismic activity in stars, enabling the precise characterisation of the planet host star, including its age.

# IMT (Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia)
IMT (Instituto Mauá de Tecnologia) is a private, non-proﬁt organization. Its main objective is to promote technical-scientiﬁc education, technological research and development aiming to provide highly qualiﬁed human resources to contribute to the socioeconomic development of Brazil. IMT was founded on December 11, 1961 its headquarters is located at Rua Pedro de Toledo, 1071 in São Paulo city. The institute maintains two units: the Centro Universitário and the Technical Services and Tests Center and two campi: one in São Paulo city and the other in São Caetano do Sul. The headquarter of the two units is located at IMT campus in São Caetano do Sul at Praça Maua, 1 with a constricted area of 130,000 m2, 12km from São Paulo city center. In this campus the Centro Universitário offers undergraduate courses in Engineering, Design, Administrations and Higher Education Certiﬁcate.

# NSEE (Nucleo de Sistemas Eletrônicos Embarcados)
[NSEE (Nucleo de Sistemas Eletrônicos Embarcados)](https://maua.br/pesquisa/grupos-pesquisa/nucleo-sistemas-eletronicos-embarcados/), created on the initiative of the Mauá de Tecnologia Institute (IMT) based on participation in the initial version of INCT INEspaço, has developed research in the area of critical systems with direct application in the aerospace area. Its performance is related to the study of electronic systems that allow solving problems by meeting severe restrictions on communication speed, mass, consumption and real-time processing. Another area of expertise involves the development of multivariable control and signal processing systems, their algorithms and embedded implementations.
